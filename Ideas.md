#Idea
- Expiration Date Checker
- Car Finding in Parking Area
- News priority based on present Location(GPS)
- Application for Grocery crowd sourcing
- Notification System with location sensing (Similar application as grocery crowd sourcing but for a generic purpose)
- Card Tracker Application/Software (Initially start with a wolfpack one card)
- An application which synchronizes and updates all of your emails from different account (Such as Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, etc.).
- Workout plan generator
  - Users need to input their basic information(heigh, weight, percentage of body fat)
  - Users need to input their expectations, such as, do they want to lose fat or build muscle
  - Expected time period. Like gain 10 lbs of muscle in 30 days
  - The program can automatically pick the right workout plan from the database
- Android Reminder/Alarm with GPS Sensor (Reminds you of what to do when you enter a particular area)
- Attendance System
- Connecting Patients to Health Professionals/Doctor
  - In rural areas the people are not able to get better health so to connect them thereby better health services
  - Can be done by making a web page as well as an application. As the rural areas just have low bandwidth so they can send symptoms via SMS services.
  -Possible to make but for checking have to check the SMS client(free is not available).
