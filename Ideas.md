- An application which synchronizes and updates all of your emails from different account (Such as Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, etc.).
- Workout plan generator
  - Users need to input their basic information(heigh, weight, percentage of body fat)
  - Users need to input their expectations, such as, do they want to lose fat or build muscle
  - Expected time period. Like gain 10 lbs of muscle in 30 days
  - The program can automatically pick the right workout plan from the database
- Android Reminder/Alarm with GPS Sensor (Reminds you of what to do when you enter a particular area)
