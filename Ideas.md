#Idea
- Expiration Date Checker
  - Typing the particular date on which the particular product is getting expired.
  - Scanning the item's date to getting the input
  - Using Voice to input the item's expiration date.
  - We can use the customizable notification for every person as to when he/she wants to get reminded about the expirations date.
- Car Finding in Parking Area
  - This has been implemented by many application and recently have been added to Google Maps as well.
- News priority based on present Location(GPS)
  - 
- Application for Grocery crowd sourcing
  - This has been expained in the issue section
- Notification System with location sensing (Similar application as grocery crowd sourcing but for a generic purpose)
- Card Tracker Application/Software (Initially start with a wolfpack one card)
  - We knew that it will be difficult to get ncsu database access as well as the other bank database access
- An application which synchronizes and updates all of your emails from different account (Such as Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo, etc.).
   - The application named Bluemail and may other are available out there even Gmail.
- Workout plan generator
  - Users need to input their basic information(heigh, weight, percentage of body fat)
  - Users need to input their expectations, such as, do they want to lose fat or build muscle
  - Expected time period. Like gain 10 lbs of muscle in 30 days
  - The program can automatically pick the right workout plan from the database
  - We are stuck with what are the 3 ways in which we can do this particular idea.
- Android Reminder/Alarm with GPS Sensor (Reminds you of what to do when you enter a particular area)
  - Reminder based on the locion where the person is and will send notification to buy things from the place if the store/place is around him/her.
- Attendance System
  - Has been explained in the issues.
- Connecting Patients to Health Professionals/Doctor
  - In rural areas the people are not able to get better health so to connect them thereby better health services
  - Can be done by making a web page as well as an application. As the rural areas just have low bandwidth so they can send symptoms via SMS services.
  - Possible to make but for checking have to check the SMS client(free is not available).
- Online ToDo List (with reminders once updated on phone should reflect on the laptop as well. similar to GoogleKeep)
- Sublease finder
  - A plateform which helps you find the person who is looking for appartments
  - I know craigslist sort of does the job, but we might need a more professional plateform.
